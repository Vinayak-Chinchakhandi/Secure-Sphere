# 🔐 Cybersecurity Tool Suite

An integrated cybersecurity platform built to enhance user safety and awareness online. This suite combines three essential tools — secure email authentication, an AI-powered cybersecurity assistant, and a phishing website detector — into one unified environment.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project was created to address key areas in cybersecurity through simple, effective tools:

- ✅ **Secure Authentication**  
  Email-based verification using one-time security codes to ensure trusted access.

- 🤖 **AI Cyber Assistant**  
  A domain-restricted chatbot trained to answer only cybersecurity-related questions. It declines non-cybersecurity queries to maintain focus and relevance.

- 🛡️ **Phishing Website Detector**  
  Detects and flags phishing URLs, explains the risks involved, and provides safety tips and recommended precautions for users.
